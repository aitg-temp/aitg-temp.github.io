									The research activities in our group fall under three broad categories : electronic and structural phase transitions in solids,
									ferroelectric and multiferroic surfaces and interfaces and photo-induced phenomena in chemical systems.
									Some current themes are outlined below.

										<h4>Bulk and interfacial magnetism & ferroelectricity </h4>

										Transition metal double perovskites (DP) having general formula A<sub>2</sub>BB’O<sub>6</sub> where A is
										alkali/alkaline earth metal cation, B and B’ are two different transition metal cation and O
										is oxygen. This is the general formula for B-site ordered double perovskite but it could be
										A-site ordered also with general formula AA’BB’O<sub>6</sub>/AA’B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>. On changing the B-site/A-site
										cation, its electronic, structural and magnetic properties could be changed which leads to
										interesting phenomena such as ferroelectricity, magnetism, multiferroicity etc. which
										could be used in various applications as in memory storage devices, spintronics etc.

										<h4>Mechanisms of Catalysis </h4>

										Chalcogenide glasses are a very interesting class of semiconductors that display a variety of photo-induced phenomena owing to their amorphous nature and disordered electronic structure.
										Motivated by nano-second pump-probe experiments on chalcogenide glasses at IISER Bhopal we are investigating the photo-induced transparency and dynamics of the transient defect states in GeSe2 and its compositional variants.
										Using a combination of classical molecular dynamics and excited-state dynamics via real-time TDDFT we are modeling the femto-second regime photo-induced changes in the semiconductors.

										<h4>Pressure and Temperature induced phenomena</h4>
									</header>
									<p style="text-align:justify;">
										<span class="image left"><img src="images/sd.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
										Effect of temperature on materials have been an important field of scientific research, as
										changes in those can lead to very interesting phenomena. On an atomistic scale, the chemical
										bonding in materials can be altered at high pressure to induce heavily distorted bonding
										environments, non-standard hybridizations of atoms, new oxidation states and spin states,
										novel electronic ground-states, etc.
										Currently we are working on several hydrogen bonded system which shows very interesting
										properties upon application of temperature and pressure. Polymerization of solid acrylamide
										under high pressure is one of them where hydrogen bonding plays key role. The effect of
										kinetics also have been studied. Also organic inorganic hybrid perovskites which exhibits
										different phases at different temperature and pressure are studied. We are also interested in
										understanding anomalous effects for instances, Negative Linear Compressibility (NLC) and
										Negative Thermal Expansion (NTE) in hydrogen bonded system.</p>

										<h4>Photo-induced phenomena</h4>

									<p style="text-align:justify;">
										<span class="image left"><img src="images/photo_reaction.png" alt="" /></span>
										Photophysics and photochemistry of DNA address the interaction of this biomolecule with light.
										This interaction (especially with the UV part of the solar spectrum) is the leading cause of
										photodamage that can lead to carcinogenesis. Nature has developed a defence mechanism so that
										the excited states of the nucleic acid bases are very stable to photochemical decay through very
										fast decay channels for the electronic excitation energy. Accordingly, comprehension of the
										photochemistry of DNA begins with a detailed and accurate knowledge of its optical response,
										which is related to the excited state properties of the nucleic acid bases. We are investigating
										photoinduced DNA damage and repair processes. We are also interested to study the inherent photo
										stability of canonical nucleobases and compare their photostability with non-canonical nucleobases
										which can answer about survival of canonical nucleobases at harsh condition during
										prebiotic time.
