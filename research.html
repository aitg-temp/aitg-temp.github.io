									The research activities in our group fall under three broad categories : electronic and structural phase transitions in solids,
									ferroelectric and multiferroic surfaces and interfaces and photo-induced phenomena in chemical systems.
									Some current themes are outlined below.

										We are investigating electron transfer mechanisms in Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs) from dyes to the semiconductor nano-particles.
										As a first phase of this project we are currently studying the ultrafast ET dynamics in the solution phase, occurring in the sub-picosecond regime - much faster than solvent relaxation.
										<br> <br> This work was motivated by time-resolved and Resonance Raman experiments performed by our collaborators at TIFR, Mumbai aimed at establishing the role of vibrations in the electron transfer.
										Their work has revealed that ET from the solvent to the solute in the excited state drastically quenches the fluorescence, and these ultrafast transfer events maybe mediated by vibrational motions of the solute.
										We are modeling these transfer events using real-time ab initio molecular dynamics and time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT).

										Chalcogenide glasses are a very interesting class of semiconductors that display a variety of photo-induced phenomena owing to their amorphous nature and disordered electronic structure.
										Motivated by nano-second pump-probe experiments on chalcogenide glasses at IISER Bhopal we are investigating the photo-induced transparency and dynamics of the transient defect states in GeSe2 and its compositional variants.
										Using a combination of classical molecular dynamics and excited-state dynamics via real-time TDDFT we are modeling the femto-second regime photo-induced changes in the semiconductors.
