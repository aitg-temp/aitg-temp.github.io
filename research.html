									Our research focuses on understanding the properties of materials from an electronic
									structure perspective. The insights thus developed enable us to rationalize experimental
									observations as well as predict new materials and new functionalities. The research
									activities in our group currently span four broad themes.

										<h4>Bulk and interfacial magnetism & ferroelectricity </h4>
									</header>
									<p style="text-align:justify;">
										<span class="image left"><img src="images/pervoskite.png" alt="" /></span>
										Transition metal double perovskites (DPs) having general formula A<sub>2</sub>BBâ€™O<sub>6</sub> have emerged
										as a wonderful playground for encoding new physics. Varying the cations sitting at
										the B-site/A-site, one can tune the electronic, structural and magnetic properties of DPs
										leading to interesting phenomena such as ferroelectricity, magnetism, multiferroicity,
										half-metallicity, metal-insulator transition, etc. We are particularly interested in
										the <i>ab initio</i> design of novel multiferroics, where magnetism and ferroelectricity can
										co-exist and talk to each other. Thin films offer epitaxial strain as another handle to
										tune the Hamiltonian of the DPs and achieve the aforementioned phenomena in the same system.
										Epitaxial strain on DP thin films can drastically change the properties of the material
										as compared to its bulk form. For instance, we found that epitaxially strained Bi<sub>2</sub>FeCrO<sub>6</sub>
										(BFCO) thin film shows a C-type antiferromagnetic (C-AFM) order which is in contrast
										to the G-AFM state obtained in the bulk (<a class = "reference" href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.93.104415">Phys. Rev. B 93, 104415 (2016)</a>).
										The effect of strain at the interface of two DP also leads to interesting properties
										such as structural phase transition, polar to non-polar,metal to insulator transition etc. We have also
										shown that coupling the epitaxial strain with A-site doping in Bi<sub>2</sub>FeCrO<sub>6</sub> a rich phase
										diagram is obtained including an unusual half-metallic multiferroic phase.

										<h4>Materials for Energy Harvesting</h4>
									</header>
									<p style="text-align:justify;">
										<span class="image left"><img src="images/solar-cell-image.png" alt="" /></span>
										Solar energy is a clean and abundant source of energy. One of the ways to effectively
										harvest solar energy is to use to split water into hydrogen and oxygen and hence storing the energy
										in the molecules. We are interested in understanding the processes involved in the photocatalytic
										water splitting reaction and designing new efficient and cost effective photocatalytic material. We use computational
										and theoretical tools to study the optical absorption, electronic structure, mechanism
										and the structure of intermediates of the overall water splitting reaction. Specifically,
										we are studying oxygen evolution reaction (OER), bottleneck of water splitting due to
										its relatively sluggish kinetics, on catalyst consisting of earth abundant elements,
										e.g. Fe, Ni, V, Bi, etc. in the context of photoelectrochemical cells. Interfaces
										between semiconductor (optical absorber) and electrocatalyst are the focus of our
										current research project. We are interested in role of interface structure and the
										dynamics charge carriers on the OER activity of these heterostructures. </p>

										<h4>Pressure and Temperature induced phenomena</h4>
									</header>
									<p style="text-align:justify;">
										<span class="image left"><img src="images/sd.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
										Effect of temperature on materials have been an important field of scientific research, as
										changes in those can lead to very interesting phenomena. On an atomistic scale, the chemical
										bonding in materials can be altered at high pressure to induce heavily distorted bonding
										environments, non-standard hybridizations of atoms, new oxidation states and spin states,
										novel electronic ground-states, etc.
										Currently we are working on several hydrogen bonded system which shows very interesting
										properties upon application of temperature and pressure. Polymerization of solid acrylamide
										under high pressure is one of them where hydrogen bonding plays key role. The effect of
										kinetics also have been studied. Also organic inorganic hybrid perovskites which exhibits
										different phases at different temperature and pressure are studied. We are also interested in
										understanding anomalous effects for instances, Negative Linear Compressibility (NLC) and
										Negative Thermal Expansion (NTE) in hydrogen bonded system.</p>

										<h4>Photo-induced phenomena</h4>
									</header>
									<p style="text-align:justify;">
										<span class="image left"><img src="images/photo_reaction.png" alt="" /></span>
										Photophysics and photochemistry of DNA address the interaction of this biomolecule with light.
										This interaction (especially with the UV part of the solar spectrum) is the leading cause of
										photodamage that can lead to carcinogenesis. Nature has developed a defence mechanism so that
										the excited states of the nucleic acid bases are very stable to photochemical decay through very
										fast decay channels for the electronic excitation energy. Accordingly, comprehension of the
										photochemistry of DNA begins with a detailed and accurate knowledge of its optical response,
										which is related to the excited state properties of the nucleic acid bases. We are investigating
										photoinduced DNA damage and repair processes. We are also interested to study the inherent photo
										stability of canonical nucleobases and compare their photostability with non-canonical nucleobases
										which can answer about survival of canonical nucleobases at harsh condition during
										prebiotic time.
