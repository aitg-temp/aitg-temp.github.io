									Our research focuses on understanding the properties of materials from an electronic
									structure perspective. The insights thus developed enable us to rationalize experimental
									observations as well as predict new materials and new functionalities. The research
									activities in our group currently span four broad themes.

										<h4>Bulk and interfacial magnetism & ferroelectricity </h4>
									</header>
									<p style="text-align:justify;">
										<span class="image left"><img src="images/pervoskite.png" alt="" /></span>
										Transition metal double perovskites (DPs) having general formula A<sub>2</sub>BBâ€™O<sub>6</sub> have emerged
										as a wonderful playground for encoding new physics. Varying the cations sitting at
										the B-site/A-site, one can tune the electronic, structural and magnetic properties of DPs
										leading to interesting phenomena such as ferroelectricity, magnetism, multiferroicity,
										half-metallicity, metal-insulator transition, etc. We are particularly interested in
										the <i>ab initio</i> design of novel multiferroics, where magnetism and ferroelectricity can
										co-exist and talk to each other. Thin films offer epitaxial strain as another handle to
										tune the Hamiltonian of the DPs and achieve the aforementioned phenomena in the same system.
										Epitaxial strain on DP thin films can drastically change the properties of the material
										as compared to its bulk form. For instance, we found that epitaxially strained Bi<sub>2</sub>FeCrO<sub>6</sub>
										(BFCO) thin film shows a C-type antiferromagnetic (C-AFM) order which is in contrast
										to the G-AFM state obtained in the bulk (<a class = "reference" href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.93.104415">Phys. Rev. B 93, 104415 (2016)</a>).
										The effect of strain at the interface of two DP also leads to interesting properties
										such as structural phase transition, polar to non-polar,metal to insulator transition etc. We have also
										shown that coupling the epitaxial strain with A-site doping in Bi<sub>2</sub>FeCrO<sub>6</sub> a rich phase
										diagram is obtained including an unusual half-metallic multiferroic phase.
										(<a class = "reference" href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.123.107201">Phys. Rev. Lett. 123, 107201 (2019)</a>).

										<h4>Materials for Energy Harvesting</h4>
									</header>
									<p style="text-align:justify;">
										<span class="image left"><img src="images/solar-cell-image.png" alt="" /></span>
										Sunlight is a clean and abundant source of energy. The direct conversion of solar energy
										into electricity is achieved through photovoltaic (PV) cells. An efficient photovoltaic
										conversion requires not only the best absorbers but also optimisation of the interfaces
										at which charge splitting and injection occur. Our group is interested in understanding
										the interfacial processes occurring in a PV cell, particularly those immediately following
										light absorption. Another way to harvest solar energy is to use it to split water into
										oxygen and hydrogen in a photo-electrochemical cell (PEC). Of the two half-cell reactions
										involved in this process, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) currently poses a practical
										challenge due to its relatively sluggish kinetics. Designing efficient and inexpensive
										catalysts (for e.g. those based on earth-abundant elements) for this purpose requires a
										detailed understanding of the interactions between the intermediates and the catalyst surfaces,
										mechanisms of the reactions involved and the energetics of the intermediates that contribute
										to the potential determining step. We are currently employing ground and excited state
										density-functional theory based tools to model interfacial processes in photovoltaic materials,
										assess the OER catalytic activity of oxides of earth-abundant elements (e.g. Fe, Ni, etc.),
										studying the charge generation process as well as the ensuing carrier dynamics across
										semiconductor/catalyst interfaces in PEC. Another area of interest in this theme is methane
										conversion. Methane is a clean fuel and a potentially wonderful source for aromatics and higher
										hydrocarbons. However, the activation of the C-H bond in methane is quite challenging not only
										because of the energetics involved but also because the currently available catalysts are based
										on expensive metals preventing large-scale implementation. We are currently investigating
										feasibility and mechanism of direct non-oxidative methane conversion on earth-abundant materials
										with the help of DFT-based tools and techniques.

										<h4>Pressure and Temperature induced phenomena</h4>
									</header>
									<p style="text-align:justify;">
										<span class="image left"><img src="images/sd.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
										Understanding the thermal behaviour of materials is crucial to designing practical applications.
										The chemical bonding in materials can also be altered at high pressure to induce heavily distorted
										bonding environments, non-standard hybridizations of atoms, new oxidation states and spin states,
										novel electronic ground-states, etc. The temperature and pressure responses of hydrogen bonded
										systems are particularly interesting given their wide occurrence in materials. Currently we are
										working on some interesting temperature and pressure induced phenomena in hydrogen bonded systems.
										Some of these are: polymerization of solid acrylamide under high pressure where the dynamic response
										of the hydrogen bonding plays key role in guiding the system towards different polymeric structures;
										temperature and pressure induced structural phase transitions in organic inorganic hybrid perovskites
										(RPbX<sub>3</sub>, R= organic cation, X=halide); and negative linear compressibility (NLC) and negative thermal
										expansion (NTE) in hydrogen bonded systems.

										<h4>Photo-induced phenomena</h4>
									</header>
									<p style="text-align:justify;">
										<span class="image left"><img src="images/photo_reaction.png" alt="" /></span>
										Photophysics and photochemistry of DNA address the interaction of this biomolecule with light.
										This interaction (especially with the UV part of the solar spectrum) is the leading cause of
										photodamage that can lead to carcinogenesis. Nature has developed a defence mechanism so that
										the excited states of the nucleic acid bases are very stable to photochemical decay through very
										fast decay channels for the electronic excitation energy. Accordingly, comprehension of the
										photochemistry of DNA begins with a detailed and accurate knowledge of its optical response,
										which is related to the excited state properties of the nucleic acid bases. We are investigating
										photoinduced DNA damage and repair processes. We are also interested to study the inherent photo
										stability of canonical nucleobases and compare their photostability with non-canonical nucleobases
										which can answer about survival of canonical nucleobases at harsh condition during
										prebiotic time.
