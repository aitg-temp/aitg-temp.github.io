									The research activities in our group fall under three broad categories : electronic and structural phase transitions in solids,
									ferroelectric and multiferroic surfaces and interfaces and photo-induced phenomena in chemical systems.
									Some current themes are outlined below.
									<br>
									<header style="margin-top: 3em;">
										<h4>Bulk and interfacial magnetism/ferroelectricity </h4>
									</header>

										We are investigating electron transfer mechanisms in Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs) from dyes to the semiconductor nano-particles.
										As a first phase of this project we are currently studying the ultrafast ET dynamics in the solution phase, occurring in the sub-picosecond regime - much faster than solvent relaxation.
										<br> <br> This work was motivated by time-resolved and Resonance Raman experiments performed by our collaborators at TIFR, Mumbai aimed at establishing the role of vibrations in the electron transfer.
										Their work has revealed that ET from the solvent to the solute in the excited state drastically quenches the fluorescence, and these ultrafast transfer events maybe mediated by vibrational motions of the solute.
										We are modeling these transfer events using real-time ab initio molecular dynamics and time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT).

										<h4>Mechanisms of Catalysis </h4>
									</header>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										Chalcogenide glasses are a very interesting class of semiconductors that display a variety of photo-induced phenomena owing to their amorphous nature and disordered electronic structure.
										Motivated by nano-second pump-probe experiments on chalcogenide glasses at IISER Bhopal we are investigating the photo-induced transparency and dynamics of the transient defect states in GeSe2 and its compositional variants.
										Using a combination of classical molecular dynamics and excited-state dynamics via real-time TDDFT we are modeling the femto-second regime photo-induced changes in the semiconductors.
									</p>

										<h4>Pressure and Temperature induced phenomena</h4>
									</header>
									<p style="text-align:justify;">
										<span class="image left"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										Effect of temperature on materials have been an important field of scientific research, as
										changes in temperature can lead to very interesting phenomena. The study of materials under
										pressure also have gained tremendous interest in recent times because of its capability to
										provide unique structural and dynamical properties not seen under ambient conditions. On an
										atomistic scale, the chemical bonding in materials can be altered at high pressure to induce
										heavily distorted bonding environments, non-standard hybridizations of atoms, new oxidation
										states and spin states, novel electronic ground-states, etc.
										Currently we are working on several hydrogen bonded system which shows very interesting
										properties upon application of temperature and pressure. Investigative polymerization of solid
										acrylamide under high pressure is one of them. We have shown the importance of hydrogen
										bonding network which response to pressure anisotropically leading to topochemical
										polymerisation. The effect of kinetics also plays important roles as fast application of
										pressure leads to different polymer. Currently we are investigating these two process of
										compression (static and dynamic) at room temperature by applying MD.</p>

										<h4>Photo-induced phenomena</h4>
									</header>
									<p style="text-align:justify;">
										<span class="image left"><img src="images/photo_reaction.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										Photophysics and photochemistry of DNA address the interaction of this biomolecule with light.
										This interaction (especially with the UV part of the solar spectrum) is the leading cause of
										photodamage that can lead to carcinogenesis. Nature has developed a defence mechanism so that
										the excited states of the nucleic acid bases are very stable to photochemical decay through very
										fast decay channels for the electronic excitation energy. Accordingly, comprehension of the
										photochemistry of DNA begins with a detailed and accurate knowledge of its optical response,
										which is related to the excited state properties of the nucleic acid bases. We are investigating
										photoinduced DNA damage and repair processes. We are also interested to study the inherent photo
										stability of canonical nucleobases and compare their photostability with non-canonical nucleobases
										which can answer about survival of canonical nucleobases at harsh condition during
										prebiotic time.
