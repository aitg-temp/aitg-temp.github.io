                                                We report a first-principles study of Bi-based 3d−5d ordered double-perovskite oxides (A<sub>2</sub>BB'O<sub>6</sub>) with a
                                                3d atom (Fe) at the B site and 5d atoms (Re, Ir) at the B' site while keeping highly polarizable ions (Bi<sup>3+</sup>)
                                                at the A site. We find that, under coherent heteroepitaxy, Bi<sub>2</sub>FeReO<sub>6</sub> exhibits a strain-driven antiferromagnetic

                                                Epitaxial strain has been shown to drive structural phase transitions along with novel functionalities in perovskite-based thin films.
                                                Aliovalent doping at the A site can drive an insulator-to-metal and magnetic transitions in perovskites along with a variety of interesting
                                                structural and electronic phenomena. Using first-principles calculations, we predict the formation of a multiferroic half-metallic phase with
                                                a large magnetic moment in the double perovskite, Bi<sub>2</sub>FeCrO<sub>6</sub> by coupling epitaxial strain with A-site hole doping. We also demonstrate that epitaxial
                                                strain can be used to manipulate the hole states created by doping to induce half-metal to insulator, antipolar to polar, antiferromagnetic
                                                to ferromagnetic, orbital ordering and charge ordering transitions. Our work also suggests that hole doping under strain could lead to mitigation
                                                of issues related to antisite defects and lowered magnetization in thin films of the material

                                                magnetic field perpendicular to the plane is studied. Contrasting and complementary approaches involving von Neumann

                                                The phase diagram consists of three phases: two metallic phases and an insulating phase. A variant model where next nearest

                                                Perovskite metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have recently emerged as potential candidates
																								for multiferroicity. However, the compounds synthesized so far possess only weak
																								ferromagnetism and low polarization. Additionally, the very low magnetic transition
																								temperatures (T<sub>c</sub>) also pose a challenge to the application of the materials. We have
																								computationally designed a mixed metal perovskite MOF—
																								[C(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>][(Cu<sub>0.5</sub>Mn<sub>0.5</sub>)(HCOO)<sub>3</sub>]—that
																								is predicted to have magnetization two orders of magnitude larger than its parent
																								([C(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>][Cu(HCOO)<sub>3</sub>]), a significantly larger polarization (9.9&mu;C/cm<sup>2</sup>),
																								and an enhanced T<sub>c</sub> of up to 56 K, unprecedented in perovskite MOFs. A detailed study of the magnetic interactions
																							  revealed a mechanism leading to the large moments as well as the increase in the T<sub>c</sub>.
																								Mixing a non-Jahn-Teller ion (Mn<sup>2+</sup>) into a Jahn-Teller host (Cu<sup>2+</sup>) leads to competing
																								lattice distortions which are directly responsible for the enhanced polarization.
																								The MOF is thermodynamically stable as evidenced by the computed enthalpy of formation
																								and can likely be synthesized. Our work represents a first step towards rational design
																								of multiferroic perovskite MOFs through the largely unexplored mixed metal approach.

																							We have investigated the effect of epitaxial strain on the magnetic properties and
																							B-site cation ordering in multiferroic Bi<sub>2</sub>FeCrO<sub>6</sub> (001) thin films using a density-functional
																							theory approach. We find that in thin films with rock-salt ordering of Fe and Cr the ground
																							state is characterized by C-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) order. This is in contrast to the
																							bulk form of the material, which was predicted to be a ferrimagnet with G-type AFM order.
																							Furthermore, the cation-ordered thin films undergo a transition with epitaxial strain from
																							C- to A-type AFM order. Other magnetic orders appear as thermally accessible excited states.
																							We also find that B-site cation-disordered structures are more stable in coherent epitaxial
																							strains, thereby explaining the lowered magnetic moments observed in these samples at room
																							temperature. Strain varies both the sign and strength of the Fe-Cr superexchange coupling,
																							resulting in a very interesting phase diagram for Bi<sub>2</sub>FeCrO<sub>6</sub> thin films.

                                        Photoinduced Charge Transfer in Solvated Anthraquinones is Facilitated by Low-frequency Ring Deformations

																							Efficiency of photoinduced charge transfer (CT) reactions in supramolecular assemblies is often
																							compromised due to the rigid parametrization of acceptable donor–acceptor (D–A) distances and
																							orientations. Using a combined approach of time-resolved optical measurements and electronic
																							structure studies guided by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we demonstrate that dynamic
																							 control on CT rate exists for quenching of hydroxy-anthraquinones in donor aniline-like solvents.
																							 We find that anthraquinone ring deformation modes control the kinetics of CT within ∼300–700 fs by
																							 modulating the D–A electronic couplings. Our work demonstrates that low-frequency motions have
																							 to be critically understood for all such D–A pairs, and generates a rational methodology for
																							 utilization of hydroxy-anthraquinone acceptors in numerous photoactive architectures.

																							Using both computational and experimental analysis, we demonstrate a rich point-defect phase

																							We investigate the quantum-mechanical localization of <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>2</sup>H isotopes in the

																							are compared to experimental neutron compton scattering data. Our results suggest a qualitative difference in the

																							Correlated electron materials can undergo a variety of phase transitions, including superconductivity,
																							 the metal–insulator transition and colossal magnetoresistance. Moreover, multiple physical phases or
																							 domains with dimensions of nanometres to micrometres can coexist in these materials at temperatures
																							 where a pure phase is expected. Making use of the properties of correlated electron materials in device
																							 applications will require the ability to control domain structures and phase transitions in these materials.
																							 Lattice strain has been shown to cause the coexistence of metallic and insulating phases in the Mott
																							 insulator VO<sub>2</sub>. Here, we show that we can nucleate and manipulate ordered arrays of metallic and insulating
																							 domains along single-crystal beams of VO<sub>2</sub> by continuously tuning the strain over a wide range of values.
																							 The  Mott  transition between a low-temperature insulating phase and a high-temperature metallic phase
																							 usually occurs at 341 K in VO<sub>2</sub>, but the active control of strain allows us to reduce this transition
																							 temperature to room temperature. In addition to device applications,the ability to control the phase
																							 structure of VO<sub>2</sub> with strain could lead to a deeper understanding of the correlated electron materials in
																							 general.
